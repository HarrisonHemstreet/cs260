        <h1>CSS - C4</h1>
        <p>
          Design a single page of a website, using HTML and CSS, that follows
          all of the principles to the best of your ability, with the exception
          that responsive design is not needed. Your page can be by about
          anything as long as it correctly represents good concepts of
          readability, usability, accessibility, and attractiveness. This is
          your chance to build something that is really beautiful and has a
          strong user experience without having to worry about functionality.
          Extra points for creativity and flare.
